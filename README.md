# Hierarchical Semantic Abstraction

A Multi-Modal Framework for Controlled Image Generation with Hierarchical Semantic Abstraction

## Project Overview

This project implements a novel framework for generating hierarchical abstract representations while preserving semantic meaning. It combines state-of-the-art vision-language models with a custom hierarchical transformer architecture to enable controlled image generation across different levels of abstraction.

## Key Features

- Hierarchical abstraction pipeline with controlled generation
- Multi-level feature transformation
- Semantic preservation mechanisms
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics
- Educational and creative applications

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/hierarchical_semantic_abstraction.git
cd hierarchical_semantic_abstraction
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Usage examples:
```bash
# Training
python main.py --config config/config.yaml --mode train

# Evaluation
python main.py --config config/config.yaml --mode evaluate --checkpoint path/to/checkpoint.ckpt

# Inference
python main.py --config config/config.yaml --mode inference --checkpoint path/to/checkpoint.ckpt --image_path path/to/image.jpg
```

The script handles three main modes:

- train: Full training pipeline with optional evaluation
- evaluate: Comprehensive model evaluation
- inference: Single image processing

## Usage

1. Configure your experiment in `config/config.yaml`
2. Prepare your data:
```bash
python -m data.dataset prepare
```

3. Train the model:
```bash
python main.py train
```

4. Evaluate results:
```bash
python main.py evaluate
```

## Training

The training pipeline includes:
- Multi-stage training process
